<h1>Game Documentation - Blackjack 21</h1>

<h2>Game Rules</h2>
<p>
    The goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.<br>
    - Aces count as 1 or 14 points<br>
    - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points<br>
    - Number cards are worth their face value<br>
    - The dealer must draw until reaching at least 17 points<br>
    - The dealer wins in case of a tie
</p>
